# Dice Recognizer 

### This is a Dice Recognizer program, which began to be initially developed around 12/14/24.
### It uses PIL and numpy to recognize what is on the face of dices.
### As of 2/16/25, it can return the number of pips it sees on screen 

## Usage
- Set the variable `path` in `main.py` (around line 15) to the path of your dice picture.
- Run `main.py`. The output should contain the number of pips

## todo
- make the code more usable
- remove bloat functions
- optomization?
